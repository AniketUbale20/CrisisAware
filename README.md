> **A dual-domain fusion platform that combines real-time emergency monitoring with AI-driven financial fraud detection to optimize civic safety and resource allocation.**

## 📌 Overview
CrisisAware addresses the "siloed data" problem in smart cities. During natural disasters, financial fraud often spikes, but emergency teams and banks work in isolation. This platform aggregates live data from **USGS (Earthquakes)** and **NASA FIRMS (Wildfires)** and correlates it with simulated financial transaction logs to detect geo-temporal anomalies.

## 🚀 Key Features
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Fetches live disaster data via open APIs with <500ms latency[cite: 121].
* [cite_start]**AI Anomaly Detection:** Uses ML heuristics to flag suspicious financial patterns occurring near disaster zones[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**Interactive Geo-Spatial Map:** Built with **Leaflet & OpenStreetMap** to visualize incidents, heatmaps, and response units[cite: 53].
* [cite_start]**Dark-Mode Dashboard:** High-contrast UI designed for command centers with "Zero-Cost" API dependency[cite: 54].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Component | Technologies |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite |
| **Mapping** | Leaflet.js, React-Leaflet, OpenStreetMap |
| **Data/AI** | Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Axios |
| **APIs** | USGS Earthquake, NASA FIRMS, OpenWeatherMap |
| **Deployment** | Netlify |

* **Live Emergency Monitor:** Real-time tracking of fire and medical incidents.
* [cite_start]**Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizing fraud prevention impact ($2.6M saved in simulations)[cite: 220].
* **AI Insights:** Predictive modeling for fire risk and resource allocation.
